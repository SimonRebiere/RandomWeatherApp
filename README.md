# RandomWeatherApp
Small weather app made in 7h30  using SwiftUI for the first time and Combine
Spent :
  -2h for the whole Combine/networker/models + pattern choice
  -4h fighting with swiftUI to get it to do what I wanted and discover how it works
  -1h retrograding app from ios15 to ios 13, to finally realize I misread the assignment so in the end put it back in ios 15 minimum to be able to use AsyncImage
  -30m writing test, that I'm not very satisfied with, but they allowed me to discover a flow in the pattern I implemented, which I did not fix since the assingment was supposed to be done in less than 8h
  
Overall interesting project even if the API that was chosen was very underwhelming and not respectful of some convention especially regarding woeid
